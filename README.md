# Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to explore data visualization and use of Tableau Public. Our assignment was to explore the data surrounding the use of Citi Bikes in New York City.

# Results

The data we first analyzed in the module was the starting location of the bike rides in NYC.

We compared this starting location to the ending location of the bike rides and we see that they are similar in the size of the data bubbles. This si probably due to people returning them to the station where they started.

We can see that after the 5 minute peak of the trip duration, the citi bikes begin to be returned.

There are approximately 70,000 more men checking out the citibikes compared to women at the 5 minute peak , which is the highest checkout for both genders.

We can see that Thursday from 5PM to 6PM has the most biking activity.

We can determine from this data  that the most biking activity for both genders is around 8AM and 5PM on weekdays.

We can see that the subscribers use the citibikes more and the most active day in the week is Thursdays.

# Summary

In this Module and Challenge, we explore the uses of Tableau and demonstrate the skills we gain by analyzing the activity of CitiBikes in NYC. The results for the trip duration and locations of the stations were interesting , noting that bikers are usually completed with their bike rides within five minutes to fifty minutes. The most suprising factor of the data was the difference between men and women bikers in the city . When we looked at the five minute peak of checked out bicycles, there were 70,000 more men who checked the bikes out than women.The last thing that was noted was the times where the bikes were checked out the most. It was notably around 8 AM and 5PM , which correlates with the normal working shift , which is 9AM to 5PM. This shows that people use these bikes to travel to and from work.
